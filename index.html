        <h4>Community Outreach</h4>
        <p>The Bakery on Main Street is proud to operate in the heart of Hillsborough. Food insecurity is at an all time high in our community and the surrounding areas, but we aim to be part of the solution. All of our unsold baked goods are donated to local nonprofits and food pantries at the end of each night. We also hold monthly community building fundraisers that benefit local homeless shelters and food pantries. Everyone deserves the peace of mind of knowing where their next meal will come from. We can achieve this together. For more information, or to get involved, contact our Community Outreach Team below. We look forward to continuing to serve our beloved Hillsborough.</p>
